# Prompt tips

## Relevant vs irrelevant files

If you know exactly what files need to be taken into account or modified, tag them in the prompt with @file_name. Else the agent can infer this information. Do not tag irrelevant files to avoid confusing the agent.

## New conversations

Start a new conversation when starting a new logical unit of work. Keep the conversation when the agent needs context from earlier in the conversation.
